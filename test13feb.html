         <li>Lata Mangeshkar was born in Indore on September 28, 1929, and became, quite simply, the most popular playback singer in Bollywood's history. She sung for over 50 years for actresses from Nargis to Preity Zinta, as well as recorded albums of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc).</li><br>
         <li>She was born the daughter of Dinanath Mangeshkar, the owner of a theater company and a reputed classical singer in his own right.</li><br>
         <li>Ironically, for someone of her stature, she made her entry into Bollywood at the wrong time - around the 1940s, when bass singers with heavily nasal voices, such as Noor Jehan and Shamshad Begum were in style.</li><br>
         <li>She was rejected from many projects because it was believed that her voice was too high-pitched and thin.</li><br>
         <li>The circumstances of her entry into the industry were no less inauspicious - her father died in 1942, the responsibility of earning income to support her family fell upon her, and between 1942 and 1948 she acted in as many as eight films in Hindi and Marathi to take care of economic hardships. She made her debut as a playback singer in the Marathi film Kiti Hasaal (1942) but, ironically, the song was edited out!</li>
